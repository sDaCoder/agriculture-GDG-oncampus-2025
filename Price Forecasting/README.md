### Objective: Farmers can use price predictions to decide 
- when to sell their grain,
- Where to sell
- Whom to sell
while traders can use them to make buying and selling decision.

#### Historical data 
- Grain selling price index: Used to predict grain purchase price
- Consumer price index: Used to identify inflation periods
- Exchange rate: Used to predict grain purchase price.
  
#### Weather patterns
- Climate variability: Droughts and other weather disruptions can impact crop prices 
- Snow: The amount of snow in the spring can impact wheat prices.
  
#### Machine learning
- Predictive analytics: AI models analyze data to predict future prices 
- Bi-DSConvLSTM-Attention model: A combination of a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network that predicts grain futures prices.
  
#### Other factors
- Supply and demand: The availability of grain and demand for it 
- Policy and macroeconomic situation: Government policies and the state of the economy can impact grain prices 
- Input costs: The cost of fuel, fertilizer, and other essentials can impact farm income
